I'D APPRECIATE IT ENORMOUSLY IF YOU COULD JUST LEAVE US IN PEACE UNTIL I FINISH THIS LOVELY PINT OF GUINNESS.

YOU AIN'T JOKING, YOU SHOULD GO.
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER REMBOARD, AIR IN THE COLD OR A SMISH TRAY.

MAKE IT.
NANA.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
AND LET ME TEACH YOU A LESSON.
WE ARE GOING TO STAND AROUND HERE ALL DAY, OR ARE WE GOING TO FIGHT?
NANA.
NANA.
NANA.
NANA.
NANA.

NANA.
LET ME TEACH YOU A LESSON.
YOU ARE OKAY, YOU ARE SICK, YOU ARE SICK.
YOU ARE SICK.
