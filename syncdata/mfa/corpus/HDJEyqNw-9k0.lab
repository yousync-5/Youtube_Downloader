SO, BEFORE YOU WAS A TAILOR, WAS YOU IN THE ARMY?
LIKE AN OFFICER.
NOT QUITE.
SO, WHERE WAS YOU POSTED A ROCK OR SOMETHING?
SORRY, ACTUALLY, CLASSIFIED.
BUT MY DAD SAVED YOUR LIFE HERE.
THE DAY YOUR FATHER DIED, I MISSED SOMETHING.
AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIS COURAGE, MY MISTAKE WOULD HAVE COST THE LIVES OF EVERY MAN PRESENT.
SO, I OWE HIM.
YOUR FATHER WAS A BRAVE MAN.
A GOOD MAN.
AND HAVING READ YOUR FILES, I THINK IT'D BE BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CHOICES YOU'VE MADE.
YOU CANNOT TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.
HUGH J.Q., GREAT PERFORMANCE AT PRIMARY SCHOOL.
AND IT ALL WENT TITS UP.
DRUGS.
PETTY CRIME.
NEVER HAD A JOB.
OH, YOU THINK THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS GOING AROUND HERE, DO YOU?
DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY YOU GAVE UP YOUR HOBBIES.
FIRST PRIZE, REGIONAL UNDERTENGED GYMNASTICS, TWO YEARS IN A ROW.
YOUR COACH HAD YOU PEGGED AS OLYMPIC TEAM MATERIAL.
YEAH, WELL, WHEN YOU GO AROUND SOMEONE LIKE MY STEP, THAT YOU PICK UP NEW HOBBIES PRETTY QUICK.
NO, OF COURSE.
ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT.
WHO'S TO BLAME FOR YOU QUITTING THE MARINES?
YOUR HALFWAY THROUGH TRAINING DOING BRILLIANTLY, BUT YOU GAVE UP.
BECAUSE MY MUM WENT MENTAL, BANGING ON ABOUT LOSING ME AS WELL AS MY DAD.
DID NOT WANT ME BEING CANNON FODDER FOR SNOBBS LIKE YOU.
JUDGING PEOPLE LIKE ME FROM YOUR IVORY TOWERS, WE'VE NO THOUGHT ABOUT WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO.
WE AIN'T GOT MUCH CHOICE.
YOU GET ME.
AND IF WE WAS BORN WITH THE SAME SILVER SPOON APART, OUR ASSES, WE'D DO JUST AS WELL AS YOU.
IF NOT BETTER.
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU ARE TAKING A PISS.
SOME MORE EXAMPLES OF YOUNG MEN HAVE SIMPLY NEEDED A SILVER SUPPOSITORY.
NO, NO EXCEPTIONS.
COME ON.
NONSENSE, WE HAVEN'T FINISHED OUR DRINKS.
AFTER YOU NICKED HIS CAR, DEAN SAYS YOU ARE FAIR GAME.
AND YOU DO NOT GIVE A SHIT WHAT YOUR MUM SAYS.
LISTEN, BOYS.
I'VE HAD A RATHER EMOTIONAL DAY.
SO WHATEVER YOUR BEEF WITH EGGSY IS, AND I AM SURE IT IS WELL-FOUNDED.
I'D APPRECIATE IT ENORMOUSLY IF YOU COULD JUST LEAVE US IN PEACE UNTIL I FINISH THIS LOVELY PINT OF GUINNESS.
YOU SHOULD GET OUT OF WHITE GRANDEUR, YOU WILL GET AN ALL.
YOU AIN'T JOKING, YOU SHOULD GO.
EXCUSE ME.
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER RENT-BOY THERE ON THE COLNRESS SMITH STREET.
NANA'S.
MAKE IT.
MAN.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
AND LET ME TEACH YOU A LESSON.
ARE WE GOING TO STAND ROUND HERE ALL DAY?
OR ARE WE GOING TO FIGHT?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO
