BERNIE. EVERYONE WAS. BERNIE WOULD DESIRE. OR BERNIE WOULD FIRE, CAUSED BY WHAT THE BUDDHA CALLED THE THREE POISONS. GREED, ANGER, IGNORANCE. EXCEPT HE TAUGHT US THAT WE CAN FIX THIS. WE CAN TURN THEM AROUND. AND GREED BECOMES GENEROSITY. ANGER BECOMES COMPASSION. AND IGNORANCE BECOMES WISDOM. THERE ARE MIRACLES AROUND US ALL THE TIME, HE SAID. THE FACT THAT WE ARE HERE TOGETHER IN THIS ROOM IS A MIRACLE. YEAH. I MEAN, SURE HE GAVE UP ALL WORLDLY GOODS, HIS FATHER'S MONEY. TOLD US ALL TO LIVE A LIFE OF A STRENGTH. AND THEN HE ENDED UP LIKE SUPER FAT, LIKE CRAZY FAT. LIKE, COME ON, DUDE. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE STATUES YOU SEE IN CHINATOWN, RIGHT? YEAH. THE BUDDHA DEPICTED THOSE STATUES. HE'S ASIAN, RIGHT? RIGHT. SO. IT'S NOT THE BUDDHA. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, THINK ABOUT IT. SO IT'S HARD TO GET OUT OF MY WASN'T INDIAN FROM NEPAL. A CHINESE MONK CAME TO INDIA THAT CAME A BUDDHIST, WENT HOME AND STARTED SPREADING THE RELIGION. THE CHINESE MIXED IN TAOISM. THEY'RE MONKS INTRODUCED. THEY HAD SHAVING THE ROBES, THE FAT, HAPPY BUDDHA NAMED HOTE. THE ACTUAL BUDDHA WAS A REGULAR MAN, NORMAL BODY, FULL HEAD OF HAIR. BUT HE WAS A GOD. NO. NEVER CLAIMED TO BE. JUST A MAN. WE THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION AND ACHIEVED ENLIGHTENMENT. LIKE JESUS, ONLY WITHOUT THE LONG BLONDE HAIR OF THE LIVES. BUT JESUS WASN'T JUST A MAN. NO. HE CLAIMED TO BE THE SON OF GOD. DIED AND WAS RESURRECTED. SO WE KNOW HE WAS DIVINE. YOU KNOW, OR YOU HAVE FAITH. YOU CAN'T ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU CAN PROVE. GOD IS BEYOND PROOF, LOGIC, OR REASON. YOU CAN BELIEVE IN GOD OR JESUS THROUGH FAITH. BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM KNOWING. WHY NO JESUS EXISTED? THERE'S HISTORICAL EVIDENCE OF THAT. AND I HAVE FAITH THAT HE WAS DIVINE. QUINE SAID FAITH IS A DIVINE ACT, SUPERNATURALLY BESTOWED. ASK ANY SHALL RECEIVE. KIERKEGAARD, ON THE OTHER HAND, SAID THAT WE MUST LEAP TO FAITH. IT IS AN ACT THAT YOU MUST CHOOSE TO PERFORM. KIERKEGAARD WAS MORE DEMANDING. HE WAS SICK OF PEOPLE SITTING AROUND TALKING ABOUT RELIGION ALL DAY AND NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I HOPE HE DIDN'T MEAN THIS CLASS, THOUGH. BUT WEREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING ABOUT BUDDHA? THEY HAD A LOT IN COMMON, JESUS AND BUDDHA. HOW SO? WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP IN THEIR PHILOSOPHIES. THEY BOTH TAUGHT THE GOLDEN RULE THAT WE SHOULD BE CHARITABLE AND NOT JUDGE OTHERS. BUT THE BUDDHA SAID YOU SHOULDN'T BELIEVE IN SOMETHING JUST BECAUSE IT'S WRITTEN IN SCRIPTURE. THE WHOLE PREMISE WITH JESUS IS TO ACCEPT ON FAITH. THAT'S A PRETTY HUGE DIFFERENCE. ALSO, THE PURPOSE OF SUFFERING, JESUS SUFFERED FOR US. WHILE THE BUDDHA'S WHOLE THING WAS TO ELIMINATE SUFFERING. ELIMINATE DESIRE. WHICH IS WHAT CAUSES SUFFERING. I KNOW. I LISTEN. I WAS LISTENING. I UNDERSTAND. OK. NEXT TIME WE WILL COVER THE PATH TO NIRVANA AND WE WILL WRAP THIS SEMESTER UP WITH JANISM. IT'S LIKE BUDDHISM BUT LAST FUN. JANE WOMEN HAVE TO BE REBORN AS MEN TO ACHIEVE ENLIGHTENMENT. WE ALL KNOW IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. THANK YOU.
