I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR RANSOM, I CAN TELL YOU I DON'T HAVE MONEY. BUT WHAT I DO HAVE, ARE A VERY PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS. SKILLS I'VE ACQUIRED ARE FOR A VERY LONG CAREER. SKILLS THAT MAKE ME A NIGHTMARE FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU. IF YOU LET MY DAUGHTER GO NOW, THAT'LL BE THE END OF IT. I WILL NOT LOOK FOR YOU. I WILL NOT PURSUE YOU. BUT IF YOU DON'T, I WILL LOOK FOR YOU. I WILL FIND YOU. AND I WILL KILL YOU. GOOD LUCK.
